NetGamers is a plugin for SupyBot_ that will handle dealing with services that take the shape of a single bot (like P on the  NetGamers network).

.. _SupyBot: http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/

I created this plugin because the Services plugin that comes with SupyBot only works with Nick-/Chanserv style services, while I need to run my bot on networks that use bots. I am not going to 
guarantee that the plugin will work for you on your network, as the bot style services are uncommon enough to not be implemented the same way. Some might work, some might work partially, and some 
wont work at all. The only bot I test with is P on NetGamers.
